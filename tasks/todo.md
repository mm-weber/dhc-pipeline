# Production-readiness critique and spec revision (one-man-show scope)

Goal: turn the 2026-08-21 security-leader critique of the catalogue into a
revised spec that (a) a single maintainer can keep honest in production and
(b) leaves the primitives in place for a fork to scale to org level without
re-architecting. Every critique point gets an explicit disposition before
anything is implemented (amend the spec first, then /spec-implement).

- [x] 1. Record the critique with repo evidence per point in
      `.specs/dhc-catalogue-mvp/reviews/2026-08-21-production-readiness-critique.md`
      (same shape as the 2026-08-04 reviews: method, verification legend,
      numbered findings, prior-art column, disposition ledger)
- [x] 2. Dialogue, one point at a time: state the goal, weigh options, record
      the disposition (accept / accept with modification / reject with reason /
      defer with primitive in place) in the review doc's ledger
      (done 2026-08-21: framing A, F1–F13 all accepted with mechanisms;
      amendment sequence A–D in the review's section 6; F12 terms memo
      landed as `data/dhi-terms-2026-08-21.md`, obligations folded into
      clusters C and D)
- [ ] 3. Spec amendments per accepted point: EARS criteria in
      `requirements.md`, rationale in `design.md`, task entries in `tasks.md`,
      one PR per cluster
      - [ ] A. release path and published set (F3, F9, F6): Req 1.9,
            2.7–2.25, 6.35–6.36; design decision 6 + release flow; tasks 9.1–9.7
      - [ ] B. statuses and clocks (F5, F4, issue closing)
      - [ ] C. upstream trust (F2, F10, F8, chart tracking, `/main` lint)
      - [ ] D. catalogue posture (F1, F11, F12, F7, register; new Req 9)
- [ ] 4. Only then: implementation PRs via /spec-implement, TDD where code
