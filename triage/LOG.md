# Triage log

Dated triage decisions: finding → evidence → outcome. One entry per triage pass.
This file is the *reasoning*; `vex/*.openvex.json` is the machine-readable form
of the `not_affected` subset, and a fix-bump PR is the machine-readable form of
the `fix` subset. Everything else lives here and nowhere else — which is the
point: the findings we did **not** excuse are as much a part of the record as
the ones we did.

## Rules this log holds itself to

Only *inapplicability* justifies `not_affected`. Three outcomes get confused and
must not be:

| Outcome | Means | Where it goes |
|---|---|---|
| `not_affected` | The vulnerable code cannot execute here | OpenVEX statement + this log |
| **prioritisation** | It is real, but low EPSS / not KEV, so it waits | this log only |
| **accepted risk** | It is real and reachable; we ship anyway | this log only, with an owner |

Writing "low risk" or "we accept it" into a VEX is **VEX-washing**: it launders a
business decision into a machine-readable claim of technical inapplicability,
and every downstream consumer inherits the lie. EPSS and KEV order the queue;
they never justify a status.

## 2026-07-26 — first triage pass (task 7.3, Req 6.4 / 6.5)

Eight open findings from the daily rescan (issues #22–#28, #30). Sorted by what
we can actually *do*, which is a property of the image's archetype:

- **cert-manager-\*** compile from source in our own pipeline → we can patch a
  vulnerable transitive dependency ahead of upstream.
- **grafana** is a tarball repackage of upstream's prebuilt binary → its
  dependency graph is fixed at upstream's build time. We can bump the whole
  release or we can reason about reachability. We cannot patch a single module.

That asymmetry, not severity, drove every decision below.

### FIX — GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf, `google.golang.org/grpc` v1.81.1 → v1.82.1 (#28)

*Images: cert-manager-controller, cert-manager-webhook (also grafana, see below).*

cert-manager v1.21.0 resolves grpc v1.81.1; upstream has not tagged a release
pinning the fix. Because we compile from source, the definition now overlays the
patched dependency at build time (`go get google.golang.org/grpc@v1.82.1` before
`go/build`) — the shipped artifact is "cert-manager v1.21.0 with grpc v1.82.1",
declared in reviewable YAML and reflected in the SBOM. This is the
`docs/concepts.md` "CVE surgery between upstream releases" path.

**Outcome: fixed.** No VEX statement — there is nothing to excuse once the
vulnerable version is not shipped. Retire the patch step when an upstream
release resolves ≥ v1.82.1.

**Why not VEX it instead?** The xDS RBAC half of this advisory plausibly does not
apply to cert-manager, and we could have argued that. We did not, because a free
fix was available. *Exhaust the fix before you argue.* A VEX written to avoid a
one-line dependency bump is technical debt with a signature on it.

### NOT AFFECTED — CVE-2026-28377, `github.com/grafana/tempo` (#27)

Tempo's HTTP `status/config` handler discloses the S3 encryption key from a
running Tempo server's configuration. This image runs Grafana's dashboard server
(`/usr/share/grafana/bin/grafana`), which vendors Tempo as a **query-side client
library** for the Tempo datasource. It does not start a Tempo server, does not
register Tempo's status routes, and holds no S3 configuration to disclose.

**Outcome: `not_affected`, `vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path`.**
→ `vex/CVE-2026-28377.openvex.json`

### NOT AFFECTED — CVE-2026-42151, `github.com/prometheus/prometheus` (#25)

The Prometheus server's config API (`/api/v1/status/config`) echoes an Azure
OAuth client secret from a running Prometheus server's scrape configuration.
Grafana vendors these packages for PromQL parsing and its Prometheus datasource
client. It does not start a Prometheus server, does not serve the Prometheus
HTTP API, and carries no scrape configuration — so there is no Azure OAuth
client secret in this image to leak.

**Outcome: `not_affected`, `vulnerable_code_not_in_execute_path`.**
→ `vex/CVE-2026-42151.openvex.json`

### AFFECTED, awaiting upstream — stdlib CVE-2026-27145 / -42504 / -39822 (#22, #24, #26)

`crypto/x509` DoS via DNS SAN processing, `mime` DoS via crafted headers, and
`os.Root` symlink traversal, all in the Go **1.26.3** standard library that
upstream built Grafana 13.0.4 with.

These are not excusable. `crypto/x509` and `mime` are on the path of any TLS
handshake and any multipart request a dashboard server handles; the vulnerable
code is linked and reachable. Nor are they fixable by us: the toolchain is
upstream's build-time choice, and a repackage image inherits it. (Our own images
are unaffected — they compile with `dhi.io/golang:1.26.5`, which is exactly why
these three appear on grafana and nowhere else in the catalogue.)

**Outcome: affected, accepted for now, tracked.** The fix is a Grafana release
built on Go ≥ 1.26.4. **13.1.1 is available and untested against these** —
Renovate now tracks grafana (ADR 0002) and will offer that bump; whether it
clears these three is an empirical question the rescan answers, not a judgement
call. Owner: catalogue maintainer. Revisit on the 13.1.1 bump PR.

### AFFECTED (grafana half) — GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf, grpc (#28)

The fix above covers the two cert-manager images. Grafana ships the same
vulnerable grpc, and we cannot patch it — grpc is reachable there via Grafana's
plugin transport (hashicorp go-plugin runs over grpc), so the "we do not use
xDS" argument covers only part of the advisory.

**Outcome: affected, accepted for now, tracked** — same 13.1.1 lever as the
stdlib findings. Deliberately **not** VEXed: a partial-inapplicability argument
is not a `not_affected` status.

### UNDER INVESTIGATION — GHSA-r277-6w6q-xmqw, `github.com/getkin/kin-openapi` (#30)

CRITICAL, and the one finding where the honest answer is "we do not know yet".
The advisory is a fail-open authentication bypass in `ValidationHandler.Load()`
when it defaults to `NoopAuthenticationFunc` — a *middleware misuse* pattern, so
whether it applies depends entirely on whether Grafana wires that handler as an
authenticating middleware, or merely vendors kin-openapi for OpenAPI schema
handling.

That is a symbol-level reachability question, and it deserves a symbol-level
answer. The tool is `govulncheck -mode=binary` against the shipped Grafana
binary, which distinguishes "module is linked" (all Trivy and Grype can see)
from "vulnerable symbol is called".

**Outcome: none yet.** No VEX statement, because "probably not exploitable" is
not a justification. Gate stays red on this finding until it is answered, which
is the correct pressure. See the follow-up below.

---

### Evidence gap, stated plainly

The two `not_affected` statements rest on **architectural** analysis — what the
shipped entrypoint is, and what the advisory's affected component is — not on
symbol-level proof. That reasoning is sound and checkable, and it is written
into each statement's `impact_statement` so a reader can disagree with it. But
it is weaker than a measurement.

Closing that gap needs `govulncheck -mode=binary` in CI, which is not yet wired.
Two constraints shaped this: the devcontainer cannot reach `vuln.go.dev` or pull
the private image (so it cannot be done locally), and our own binaries build with
`-w -s`, which may degrade govulncheck to module-level precision on them.
Grafana's binary is upstream's build and may fare differently.

**Follow-up:** add a govulncheck reachability job to the PR scan path, and
revisit #30 and both `not_affected` statements with it. Until then this
paragraph is the honest caveat on the two statements above.
